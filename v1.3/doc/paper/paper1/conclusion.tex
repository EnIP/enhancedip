\section{Conclusion}
This paper described several migrations and modifications to solve
problems that arose in the Internet Protocol suite.  The NCP to TCP
transition was very disruptive and possible at a time when not many
people, governments, and businesses were dependent on the network.
It is difficult to imagine deploying a new Internet protocol using a flag 
day approach.  The migration to classless addresses
was beneficial and not disruptive.  Network Address Port Translation
developed out of necessity and solved many privacy and address
problems and admittedly created some minor ones.  IPv6 seems to
be disruptive and its implementation appears difficult.  The days of
experimenting on the network anywhere at anytime are long over.  There are
too many people and livelihoods dependent on the network for critical
services.  The next transition must be simple.  This literature survey is used as the basis 
for further research on IP extensions.  Specifically, it was used to 
inform research on another protocol known as Enhanced IP.
