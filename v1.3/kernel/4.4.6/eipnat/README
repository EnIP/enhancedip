-make sure the kernel was built by following the instructions
 at README.ubuntu.  

-type 'make' to build eipnat.ko

-you'll need to load the scripts nat_N1.sh and nat_N2.sh, but before you run
them you'll need to open them in a text editor and edit the MASQ_IP and NIC_NAME variables 
to change them to your setup.  You may also need to adjust the 2 iptables masquerade 
commands in this file.  If you want to see these files in action look at the configuration
being used in N1 and N2 VMs that can be downloaded here: http://www.enhancedip.org/ENIP/

-If you are building N1, type the following:
   sh nat_N1.sh

-If you are building N2, type the following:
   sh nat_N2.sh
