#################################################################

You need an Enhanced IP aware NAT/router and a computer behind that device running the Enhanced IP version of the Linux kernel.
You also need a DNS server serving Enhanced IP/IPv6 records.  This document will guide you through the process of compiling
everything you need.

This document will tell you how to get both of these.

Enhanced IP aware NAT/router
============================
1) Follow the instructions in kernel/3.10.49/eipnat/README to build an openwrt router with Enhanced IP support.


Enhanced IP version of the Linux kernel
=======================================
1) Load the patched 4.4.6 kernel on all your linux machines that you want to have Enhanced IP.
   Follow the instructions here:

	kernel/4.4.6/README.ubuntu

2) Build the user-space utilities
	
	sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
	make
	make install

3) To see the newly installed commands type 'e_' followed by two tabs to see a listing of new commands.
   Type each of the new commands to get help.

4) Open the file 'bind-config/README.bind' and follow the instructions for installing an EnIP DNS server.

5) In recent versions of sshd, IP options are blocked. We have a patched version of openssh that allows IP
   options for use with Enhanced IP (grep for 'enhanced ip' in canohost.c).  
      
     Install 'userspace/openssh-7.2p1.tar.gz'

	cd userspace
	tar -xvzf openssh-7.2p1.tar.gz
	cd openssh-7.2p1
	./configure
	make

     Temporarily install alternate sshd
	/etc/init.d/ssh stop
	/home/yourdir/v1.2/userspace/openssh-7.2p1/sshd 

     Permenantly install alternate sshd
	Sorry, no instructions for that at this point.

6) General Recommendations:
	1) Check out http://www.enhancedip.org/docs for details on EnIP architecture.
	2) If you're just starting out, it's probably best to download the demo
	virtual machines on our web site.  All of the software comes precompiled and setup.
	3) Debugging Tip: in userspace/netcat is a program similar to netcat and that can
	 be used with netcat.  This program is useful for bringing up an EnIP
	 system.  Along with tcpdump and tshark it is possible to verify that
	 all the IP addresses are being switched in the appropriate places.  If
	 you can get userspace/netcat/ working, then more complex programs like ssh, apache,
	 samba, etc. should work.  We'd recommend getting this program working
	 before setting up DNS.
