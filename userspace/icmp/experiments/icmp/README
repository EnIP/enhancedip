We took the quantcast (quantcast-top-million.zip) top 1 million list and grabbed the top 10,000 web 
sites for our experiment.  The idea was to send regular ping to the top 10,000 web sites and see
which web sites sent ICMP echo responses.  We then repeated this experiment with ICMP echo requests
where the IP header contained IP options.  Specifically, we formatted the options header to include
option number 26 with the copy bit.  We formatted the IP option to be 12 bytes just as is the case
with Enhanced IP. 

Here are a few of the files that are important:
dns.txt          -  A record lookups for the top 10000 web sites on the net 
ipaddr_eping.sh  -  script to run enhanced ip ping of the top 10000 web sites
ipaddr_ping.sh  -   script to run regular ip ping of the top 10000 web sites

Check out the results/ for the output from the scripts.  

Here are some highlights:
-11768 regular pings succeeded
-1654  regular pings failed
-185   regular pings failed because of an ICMP type/code

-11729 pings with options succeeded
-1682  pings with options failed
-187   pings with options failed because of an ICMP type/code

Here's the breakdown of the icmp type/codes that were seen.
3-destination unreachable, 3-port unreachable
3-destination unreachable, 9-Communication with Destination Network is Administratively Prohibited
3-destination unreachable, 10-Communication with Destination Host is Administratively Prohibited
3-destination unreachable, 13-communication administratively prohibited
8-echo 0-no code
12-parameter problem, 0-pointer indicates the error
