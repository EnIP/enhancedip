tcp_ping crafts a SYN packet and waits for the responding SYN+ACK packet.  When the -o option
is set on tcp_ping the SYN packet is crafted so that the packet contains IP options.  The IP
option set is 12 bytes in length.  The option number is set to 26 with the copy bit set.  This
simulates an Enhanced IP packet.
