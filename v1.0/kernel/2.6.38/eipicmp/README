The eipicmp module is a proof of concept to show ICMP
ping works for Enhanced IP.  The code needs more work.
Specifically, the code makes use of dev_queue_xmit()
when it should probably make use of ip_queue_xmit().


I couldn't figure out how to call ip_queue_xmit() in the
available time that I had so I left the proof of conccept
code using dev_queue_xmit().  Because I used dev_queue_xmit
it is necessary to set the source and destination mac
addresses.  THe source mac address would be the mac address
of the interface the packet is originating from.  The
destination mac address is most likely going to be your
default gateway.  In the code, change these variables to
get things working.

static u_char *smac = "\x08\x00\x27\x43\x97\xa2";
static u_char *dmac = "\x08\x00\x27\x76\x1d\xa2";

This all assumes you have a working Enhanced IP setup.
If you download the one off the web, then things should
work just fine.

Use the 'eping' program contained in [1] to create
regular pings as well as Enhanced IP pings.
