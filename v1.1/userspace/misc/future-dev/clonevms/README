This is a horrible work in progress where I am attemptng to 
shrink down the size of our virtual machine environment from
10 Gigs to about 2.5 Gigs.  I take one virtual machine (N2)
and copy it three times to create EIP1, EIP2, and N1.  Since
the machines are very similar we can make copies and tweak
individual machine configs to get the setup we want.  The 
setup.bat script is still buggy.  Don't expect it to work for 
you.  Do feel free to improve on it.
