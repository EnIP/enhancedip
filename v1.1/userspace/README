USEFUL PROGRAMS
-----------------------
eipclient - a program capable of making TCP and UDP connections over
            enhanced IP.  It's a little like netcat but the syntax isn't presently
	    the same.


NOT SO USEFUL PROGRAMS
-----------------------
icmp 	  - ping,traceroute, and measurement programs that have an enhanced ip flare

future-dev - a dumping ground for programs that are useful but not yet 
 	     really useful.  Unless you're a developer, you can probably
	     ignore this.
