To build:
	'make'

To get a file from 10.3.3.2 that is listening with netcat:

on 10.3.3.2 (EIP2) (the server in this example):

	dd if=/dev/urandom of=/root/hello bs=1 count=1500
	md5sum /root/hello
	#listener port = 83
	nc -l -p 83 -u < /root/hello

on 10.1.1.2 (EIP1) (the client in this example):
	#From EIP1 to EIP2 using UDP
	./netcat 10.1.1.2 10.3.3.2 83 udp > /root/hello
	** after a couple seconds hit Ctrl+c to stop netcat **
	md5sum /root/hello
	** the checksums should match


The above example can be done for tcp by changing two things.
	1) remove the -u from the nc command
	2) change udp to tcp in the ./netcat line.
