1) Copy the modified nf_nat_l3proto_ipv4.c to /usr/src/linux-3.15.3/net/ipv4/netfilter/
2) Build the kernel modules.  Assuming you already have the 3.15.3 kernel installed and
   running you can rebuild the NAT modules with make -j.  Install the updated
   NAT kernel modules with make modules_install.  Reboot the system.
3) Type 'make' to build the Enhanced IP driver.  (eipnat.ko)

4) To load the new NAT module as well as the Enhanced IP module run one of 

sh nat_N1.sh 
 or 
sh nat_N2.sh 

5) There are values that may need to be changed at the beginning of nat_N1.sh and nat_N2.sh.
The default values in the scripts are setup to function properly with the virtual machines 
available on our web site: www.enhancedip.org.  We recommend using the virtual machines for 
starting development as it makes setting up the dev environment simpler.
