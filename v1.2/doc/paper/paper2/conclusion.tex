\section{Conclusion}
This paper described the operation of an extension to IP called Enhanced IP or EnIP.
EnIP provides a solution to the IPv4 address depletion problem and
includes an integration plan, much of which is based on the idea that
EnIP can extend IPv4 instead of replacing it.  The authors believe the integration plan
is feasible and based on sound economic principles.

There is work to be done.  This includes evaluation of EnIP by other parties, 
consideration of other protocols, 
development of EnIP upgrades for a large variety of operating systems, as well as evaluation of the
performance and security of existing EnIP implementations.  Much further development and analysis
is needed.  The interested reader might also consider reading the work done in IPv4+4\cite{Stand04,Stand05},
as many of the design goals in this paper are similar to EnIP.
